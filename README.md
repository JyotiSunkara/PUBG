# PUBG 

An OpenGL implementation of a three-dimensional third-person-shooter open world game inspired by the wildly popular Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). 

## Manual

## **`Argon`**

The name is derived from the Greek work *`argos`*, meaning idle. The main character in the game is a shiny steel Cyborg who is seemingly weaponless and defenseless much like the unreactive noble gas Argon. Argon The Cyborg however has impeccable mind control on all weaponry except modern drones. He has his personal powerful weapon in this game, the Jölnir which he can reload and fire as he wishes.

## **`Jölnir`**

Jölnir is the gun of Argon, the Cyborg associated with mind control. Jölnir is one of the most fearsome and powerful weapons in existence, capable of annihilating drones. It carries `20` bullets at once and can annihilate with a 500 metre range.

## **`Drones`**

Drones are spawned in the world around Argon and as soon as they come into existense they take up the single minded goal of attacking Argon The Cyborg. They zoom towards Argon's position in the world and if a drone comes in contact with Argon, the game has been lost.

## **`Context`**

As soon as the game begins Argon is free to move in the world surrounded by mountains using the controls. `50` drones are spawned in total at different points in time and space. If all `50` drones are annihilated by Argon, he wins the game. If any drone collides with Argon, the game is lost. Argon has a total of `5` health tokens which means he can refill the gun `5` times. Every refill of the gun gives Argon `30` bullets. The score is calculated based on how many drones Argon has annihilated, where `10` points are given for each annihilated drone! The time remaining is also displayed on the scree which means Argon must get rid of the drones as fast as possible. The remaining time is added to the final score and hence Argon must remain incentivised to finish the win the game as fast as possible!

## Controls

## **`W A S D`**
The above four keys can be used to move forward, lefward, backward and righward respectively.

## **`F`**

## **`C`**
Clears the sky by getting rid of the foggy envelope, if present.

## **`Space Bar`**
Hit the spacebar to make Argon take a tiny leap. This can be used in combination with movement to create bounding leaps across the terrain!

## **`Mouse Control`**
The mouse can be user to orient Argon in the direction of choice by moving it!

## **`Right Click`**
This makes Argon and The Jölnir move forward in the currently facing direction.

## **`Left Click`**
This is cause The Jölnir to fire a bullet at the point pointed at by the reticle in the centre of the screen.
